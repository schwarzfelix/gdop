# Real-Time GDOP Calculation and Visualization

This project is a Python-based tool designed for real-time calculation and visualization of Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP). It features interactive manipulation of anchor positions, dynamic GDOP updates, and visualization of 2D geometric relationships. The tool is ideal for analyzing localization algorithms and understanding the impact of anchor geometry on positioning accuracy.
